\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:S41}
This chapter summarizes the configuration of the x-ray irradiation system at Bonn university, and provides the calibration procedure of the machine. A measurement of the maximum absorbed dose is presented and discussed. 

\section{Main Characteristics and Setup}
\label{sec:S42}
The available x-ray tube uses a high voltage to accelerate electrons released by thermoionic effect in the electric field set by the operational voltage of the machine. The tube can be operated in a voltage range of $2$\si{\kilo\volt} to $60$\si{\kilo\volt} and continuously powered at  $3.5$ \si{\kW}. The characteristics of the tube are summarized in Tab~\ref{tab:t42}. The tube parameters are adjustable using power graphic LCD display with soft keys. The tube itself is installed at the top of a $110 \times 70 \times 103$ \si{\cm} aluminum cabinet with lead-glass front window so that all measurements are performed inside this radiation safe housing. In normal operation, the tungsten spectrum produced inside the tube is then registered by a beryllium window. After that the energy  of the generated photons will be attenuated by one of the pre-specified filters available in the filter holder. The filter holder includes $5$ different interchangeable filters for different purposes. At $1$ \si{\centi\metre} away after, a $1.5$\si{\centi\metre} collimator with a hole with radius $0.6$ \si{\centi\metre} is fixed in the collimator holder. In this way, the closest achievable distance to the beryllium window is $2.5$\si{\centi\metre}. This configuration allows obtaining higher dose rates for DUT as a consequence of the need for larger TID levels required to test microelectronics in view of LHC detector upgrades. The position of the DUT under the center of the beam spot can fixed  using two laser beams fixed at the to of the cabinet.

\section{Geant4 Simulation}
\label{sec:sim43}
A measurement of the x-ray spectrum is very crucial since the x ray distributions influence the penetration of the x rays through the target and so the absorbed radiation dose received. However, experimental measurement of the X-ray spectrum is often not possible since the count rates are too high for detectors with a suitable resolution. That is why an accurate measurement of the X-ray spectrum is complex and time consuming and a simulation in this case is a more convenient way to get the spectrum. For that purpose Geant4 simulation (Version $4.10$.p01 compiled with CLHEP $2.1.3.1$ libraries) toolkit has been used to simulate the x ray spectrum produced by the tube and study the effect of tube potential and filtration on the beam intensity.
\subsection{Generation of X-ray Spectra} 
\label{sec:sim431}
During simulation,the pure tungsten spectrum of the X-ray tube was generated by shotting $10^8$ electrons with an energy of $50$ \si{\kilo\electronvolt} on a $5$ \si{\milli\metre} tungsten anode at a distance $8.5$ \si{\milli\metre} inside a vacuum volume of size $8 \times 1.5 \times 1.5$ \si{\cm}. The spectrum is then registered by a $0.3$ \si{\milli\metre} beryllium window at $1$ \si{\centi\metre} away. The geometry of the set up is shown in figure~\ref{fig:sim431}.
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.5\textwidth}

\end{wrapfigure}
Two specific models for optimizing low energy electromagnetic radiation are available in Geant4: \textit{livermore}\footnote{livermore model updated by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}~\cite{Livermore} and \textit{penelope}\footnote{penelope: PENetration and Energy LOss of Positrons and Electrons}.
Fig~\ref{fig:61a} shows a pure tungsten x ray spectrum before the beryllium window. Results obtained with \textit{penelope} showed a larger intensity for the characteristic tungsten lines $L_\alpha, L_\beta$ and $L_\gamma$ (See Tab.~\ref{tab:decays}) compared to the bremsstrahlung slope. In this chapter, \textit{penelope} model is chosen as the optimal model for x ray spectrum replicas. The  model provides a good description of the transport of \si{\kilo\electronvolt} electrons and the generated electrons tracks  based on the cross sections described in ref.~\cite{trove,Khan}. The model has been tested and compared with experimental data elsewhere (See ref.~\cite{Pen}).

\end{subfigure}
\hspace*{\fill} \caption{Simulation results using Geant4 for x ray spectrum from a $5$ \si{\milli\metre} tungsten anode without any filters.} 
\end{figure}
Fig~\ref{fig:61b} shows simulated spectrum of the x ray tungsten anode without any filters using \textit{penelope} model at different electron energies. These results reflects the influence of the acceleration voltage on the tube spectrum. The figure generally show that the maximum x ray energy (in \si{\kilo\electronvolt}) of the x ray spectrum is equal to the energy of the incident electron (and so the tube voltage), that was excepted as shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:341}. Furthermore, the overall intensity the characteristic x rays increases with increasing the energy of the incident electron (and so the tube voltage). This result reveal that the acceleration voltage determines the qualitative composition, which implies the relative number of generated x ray photons and the maximal photon energy of the spectrum.
%===================================================================
\subsection{Effect of Spectrum Filtration} 
\label{sec:sim432}
As mentioned in ~\ref{sec:S34}, filters are used to tune the spectrum by suppressing the undesirable wavelength like very low-energy photons. There has been considerable debate in the literature about the optimal material to be used for x-ray beam filters ~\cite{Nagel,Villagran}. The choice of the optimal filter depends on the experimental purpose and the wavelength needed to be excluded. This is possible by matching materials with particular absorption characteristics to different x-ray source spectra. The available x-ray tube is provided with $5$ different $K_{\beta}$filters (Vanadium(V-$15$\si{\um}), Manganese(Mn-$25$\si{\um}), Iron(Fe-$15$\si{\um}), Nickel(Ni-$15$\si{\um}) and Zirconium(Zr-$75$\si{\um})) with the possibility to add extra filter out of the list as required in the test to ensure reasonably uniform dose rate in the DUT.\newline

 \end{subfigure}
 \caption{The effect of different filters with the same thickness $150$ \si{\um} on the original x ray tungsten spectrum}
\end{figure} 
Fig.~\ref{fig:sim333} shows the mass attenuation coefficient as a function of photon energy of the available filters. As seen, some filter materials like V ($K^{V}=5.46$\si{\keV}), Mn($K^{Mn}=6.53$\si{\keV}), Fe ($K^{Fe}=7.11$\si{\keV}) and Ni ($K^{Ni}=8.33$\si{\keV}) give rise edges a few \si{\keV} before the tungsten edge ($L^{W}_{I,II,III}=10.21,11.54,12.1$\si{\keV})\footnote{$L_{I}$ edge: $L_{\alpha_3},L_{\beta_3} $ and $L_{\beta_4}$} , \footnote{$L_{II}$ edge: $L_{\gamma_1}$ and $L_{\beta_1}$}\footnote{$L_{III}$ edge: $L_{\beta_2},L_{\alpha_1}$ and $ L_{\alpha_2}$}. As a result, the same thickness of these filters will attenuate the spectrum in the same manner. While a filter material of the same thickness like Zr ($L^{Zr}_{I,II,III}=2.22 ,2.30, 2.53$ \si{\keV} and $K^{Zr}=17.9$\si{\keV}) will attenuate more, since it has two rise edges. The values corresponding to the absorption edges are taken from~\cite{Barometry} while the data for absorption coefficient are available at~\cite{XCOM1}. This effect  on the tube spectrum has been simulated using Geant4. The aim of this simulation is: First, to confirm the results shown in figure~\ref{fig:333} for different filters with the same thickness ($150$ \si{\um}). Second, to study the effect of the available filters with the indicated thicknesses in table ~\ref{tab:Sim431b} on the x ray spectrum generated from the tube.\newline

\end{wrapfigure}
In order to reduce the simulation time, the program was divided into two steps. First, the pure tungsten spectrum of the X-ray tube was generated as in section~\ref{sec:sim431} by shotting electrons with an energy of $50$ \si{\kilo\electronvolt} on a $5$ \si{\milli\metre} tungsten anode at a distance $8.5$ \si{\milli\metre} (See Fig. ~\ref{fig:sim431}). Second, the tungsten spectrum passed through the beryllium window is used as input for the second step where the effect of different filters and collimators could be studied. The energy will be attenuated by the specified filter placed at $3$ \si{\centi\metre} away after a $2$\si{\centi\metre} lead collimator with a hole of radius $0.5$ \si{\milli\metre} to collimate the beam. The output spectrum after the specified filter is registered at the backside of the filter. The geometry is shown in figure~\ref{fig:sim4322}. \newline
Fig. ~\ref{sec:app1} shows the simulation results using different filters of thickness $150$ \si{\um}. The results confirm the data taken from~\cite{XCOM1} where Zr filter with  $150$ \si{\um} can attenuate $98\%$ from the original spectrum. This effect decreases as the absorption edge of the element decrease (See table ~\ref{tab:Sim431b}).The intensity loss from the original spectrum is shown in Tab. ~\ref{tab:Sim431b}

\end{table} 
Fig. ~\ref{fig:bothfilters} shows the simulation results using two x ray filters current x ray tube. Thickness needed for simulation are taken from the x ray tube specifications in Tab.~\ref{tab:Sim431b}. As a result, an Al$150$ \si{\um} filter attenuates only $70 \%$ from the original intensity, where most of the rejected photons are of an energy between $0$ to $5$ \si{\kilo\electronvolt}. While Zr-$75$\si{\um} filter attenuates $92\%$ from the original intensity and the majority are ranging between $0$ to $45$ \si{\kilo\electronvolt}. This behavior must be considered during irradiation where the choice of filters is a trade off between the dose rate obtained and the energy of contribution from low energy photons.

\section{System Characterization}
\label{sec:S43}
The essential information required for the characterization of an x-ray system is the X-ray dose rate as a function of tube current, tube voltage, and distance from the source. The effects of various source filters on dose are also of interest. The measure of radiation due to x-rays is commonly expressed in \textbf{Roentgen} unit. A Roentgen (R) is defined as the quantity of X- or gamma radiation that produces a charge of $2.58 \times 10^{-4}$ coulombs in one kilogram of dry air at $0^o$C~\cite{Sprawls}. In most applications, radiation effects in other materials (e.g., silicon) are of primary interest, and the energy deposited per unit mass is a more meaningful measure of dose. For example, a dose of $1$ rad is defined as an energy deposition of $100$ erg/g of material. The official SI dose unit is the Gray, however the rad is still widely used where $1$ Gy = $1$ joule/kg = $100$ \si{\mm}.\newline
%===================================================================
\subsection{Size and Shape of the x-ray Beam}
\label{sec:S433spot}
The available x-ray tube has a Long Fine focus (LFF) with high diffraction line resolution and high intensity. The tube is equipped with four Beryllium windows with optical focal spot at $6^o$ take-off angle. Two windows deliver point focus with dimensions $0.4\si{\mm} \times 1.2$\si{\mm} (point) and two deliver line focus with dimensions $0.04\si{\mm} \times 12$\si{\mm} (Line). When positioning the device under test (DUT), it is important to consider the size and shape of the x-ray beam. A dosimetric film ($0.4$\si{\mm} thick) can give an immediate qualitative view of the beam profile by observing the color change of the film from orange to black when it is exposed to ionizing radiation. Where the darkness  of the film informs about the absorbed dose. The film is positioned in the reference point of the two intersecting laser beams, this point represents the center of the beam spot. This point is well aligned at an angle of $90^o$ with the plan of the film. It should be added that the reference point is  a good approximation for the center of the beam spot at small distances from the beam spot. On the other hand, this is not perfectly true for large distances from the beam spot - as will be shown later.

The foil was irradiated for \si{\hour} in each case (tube settings: $40$\si{\kilo\volt}, $50$ \si{\milli\ampere}, No Filter). The degree of darkness is less for the profile measured further away from the tube. The beam radius increases.} \label{fig:S433}
\end{figure} 
Fig ~\ref{fig:S433} shows the recorded beam profiles at two different depths from the collimator holder as indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam} under tube settings of $40$\si{\kilo\volt}, $50$ \si{\milli\ampere} without any filters. The beam spot takes circular like shape which shows an inhomogeneous absorbed dose over the entire surface as the color shows, which means that the x-rays are not evenly emitted by the tube. This qualitative image is refined with the help of the calibrated PIN diodes later in section~\ref{sec:S435}. \newline
%===================================================================
\subsection{Determination of the Opening Angle}
\label{sec:S433}
The x-rays leave the tube in a beam cone with opening angle $\theta$. This angle reflects the beam path in the tube and allows to estimate the irradiated area under the beam spot (see Sec.~\ref{sec:S341}). The beam angle can be determined by measuring the beam profile at different heights using dosimetric films ($0.4$\si{\mm} thick). 
The opening angle of the X-ray tube can be then calculated using the geometry in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam} by measuring the increase of the beam radius $(r_1-r_2)$ for a given difference in height $\Delta h$ assuming that the beam profile is circular. The opening angle $\theta$ can be defined as: 
\begin{equation}
\theta=\frac{2(r_2-r_1)}{\Delta h}
\label{eq:S4331}
\end{equation}
 \begin{table}

	\end{minipage}
\end{table} 
Fig ~\ref{fig:4332}, shows the linearity relation between the height and the radius of the beam profile based on the data taken for the beam at different heights from the same central position relative to the collimator holder(See Tab.~\ref{tab:S433}). It is important to note that, the beam profile it self loses its circular geometry at large heights and give a shallow circular like shape. This makes the measurement of the radius practically hard and only possible by averaging the radii measured from different positions on the circle edge and considering the error in the calibration. The result is a linear relation that gives a slope, a= $0.071\pm0.002$ and an offset, $b =(0.448\pm 0.032)$. Based on Eq.~\ref{eq:S4331}, the slope (a) should corresponds to the opening angle $\theta/2$:
\begin{equation}
\theta=(0.142\pm 0.005)^{rad}
\label{eq:S43323}
\end{equation}
Consequently the focal point of the tube ($h_\text{fp}$) can be calculated using the fit results in Fig~\ref{fig:4331}. Assuming that the beam spot is a point like ($r=0$). Therefore $h_0=6.291\pm 0.445$ \si{\cm}. Since, the exit window is located at $2.5$ \si{\cm}from the collimator holder~\ref{fig:41a}, then the focal point is expected to be at:
\begin{equation}
h_\text{fp}= 3.791\pm 0.445 \si{\cm}
\label{eq:S43324}
\end{equation}
where $h_\text{fp}$ is the distance below the exit window to the focal point.

Another measurement for the data obtained with a collimated beam using a collimator with $18.5$ \si{\mm} length and inner radius of $r=5.5$ \si{\mm} after an Aluminum (Al-$150$ \si{\um}) filter is shown in~\ref{sec:app1collimated}. The absolute uncertainties on the radius measurement are less than the data taken for the non-collimated beam (See Tab~\ref{tab:S433} and Tab~\ref{tab:S433collimated}) as the circular shape is will defined due to the the effect of the collimator.

\subsection{Photodiodes Dosimetry Calibration} 
\label{sec:S431}
In order to relate the ionizing radiation due to x-rays to its corresponding dose in rad, a radiation dosimetry technique has to be applied using a pre-calibrated silicon diode (where the corresponding dose rate per diode current is already known). This technique provides an accurate and direct readout of the radiation dose. \newline
For calibration, three silicon diodes with an active area of $1$\si{\mm}$^2$~\cite{diode} and an effective collection depth of about $50$\si{\um} have been used. This depth is very  sensitive compared to the devices to be irradiated. Two unique properties of the photodiodes used for the calibration. The first property is the absence of a surface dead region~\cite{Opto}. As a result, no recombination of photo generated carriers in the doped n-region or at the silicon-silicon dioxide interface. This yields complete collection of the photogenerated carriers by an external circuit resulting in $100\%$ carrier collection efficiency~\cite{Funsten}. The second property is the diode thickness which can cover the dynamic range for the dose rates of interest.

\subsection*{Calibration Facility Description}
 X-ray irradiation machine (Seifert RP149) at CERN can operate at maximum voltage of $50$\si{\kilo\volt} with current reaches to $60$\si{\mA}. The X-ray tube using a tungsten target (peak 10 keV) with Beryllium window of thickness $0.25$\si{\mm} to seal the tube. The maximum achievable dose rate variable up to above $9$Mrad/hour~\cite{CERNxray}. The machine has its own calibration curves that yield the dose rate as a function of the current for their pre-calibrated PIN diodes. Fig.~\ref{fig:421} shows the calibration curves at three different tube voltages($30, 40$ and $50$\si{\kilo\volt}) at a fixed distance of $3$\si{\cm} between photodiode and the tube as a function of the diode current in \si{\mA} (with $0.15$\si{\mm} Aluminum filter).Typical x-ray induced currents in the PIN diode are in order of \si{\mA}.

For more calibration measurements at different depths between photodiode and the tube are available at~\cite{CERNxray}} \label{fig:421}.
\end{figure}
\subsection*{Calibration Technique}
Calibration procedure of the machine follows the same procedure to calibrate the photodiodes in a reverse way. During calibration, the photodiode was inversely polarized at $52$\si{\volt}.The diode is then aligned with the x-ray beam center using a laser pointer. The background is estimated by measuring diode current in the absence of x-rays inside the x-ray cabinet. A calibration is then made by measuring the diode current, at a given X-ray tube voltage ($40$\si{\kilo\volt}), for with tube current ($50$\si{\milli\ampere}) and at different distances between photodiode and the tube($2, 3$ and $8$\si{\cm}) at $\num{22}^o$C (See table~\ref{tab:42b}. The procedure is repeated for three photodiodes of the same characteristics.
Since the dose rate corresponds to each tube current at each distance is already known (See Fig.~\ref{fig:421}), a conversion factor ($F$) that yields the absorbed dose rate in the $SiO_2$ layer of the diode if the diode current is known can be defined as
\begin{equation}
F=\frac{\text{Dose Rate} [\si{\mega\radian/\hour}]}{\text{Diode current} [\si{\micro\ampere}]}
\label{eq:421}
\end{equation}

\begin{tabular}{c|ccccc}

The final calibration factor $F$ for the photodiodes under test based on equation ~\ref{eq:421} is shown in table~\ref{tab:42b}. As shown in the table, The conversion factor (F) is independent of the distance and can be considered as direct readout of the radiation dose. 

\subsection{X-ray Tube Calibration} 
\label{sec:S432}
Calibration of the X-ray tube has been performed as with one of the pre-calibrated photodiodes referenced in section ~\ref{sec:S431}. The calibration is made measuring the diode current, at a given X-ray tube voltage, for $5$ different tube currents and with the diode centered exactly under the beam spot (Which is roughly the middle of the region with the highest intensity). For each of these, the dose rate is obtained using the conversion factor F (See table~\ref{tab:42b}). A fit is then done to obtain the dose rate at any current. The procedure is repeated for different voltages and for different distances DUT-tube. Figure~\ref{fig:432a}, shows the reported values with one of the calibrated diodes (Diode II) with/without the Aluminum filter. Where the absorbed dose rate in $SiO_2$ can 
proportional to the current drawn by the diode as shown in table~\ref{tab:42b}. As expected, Measurements shows that the absorbed dose rate increases nearly linearly with X-ray tube current. The maximum achievable dose rate at $8$\si{\cm} ($50$\si{\milli\ampere}, $40$\si{\kilo\volt}, without Filter) is $7.31$ \si{\mega\radian/\hour}. However, the measured values for dose rate corresponds to each tube current show a drop of $\approx(60-70)\%$ in case of the same settings applied  using $0.15$\si{\mm} Aluminum filter. This behavior confirms the simulation results  introduced in section~\ref{sec:sim43}using Geant4 (See Figure~\ref{fig:sim432a,fig:sim432b}).
Another factor influence quantitatively the dose rate measurements is the applied voltage which is more effective at high voltages. Measurements shows a dependence on the applied voltage. Where a decrease of  $\approx15\%$ is observed  at lower voltage of $30$\si{\kilo\volt}. This dependence has been studied separately by measuring the dose rate at a given X-ray tube current, for $5$ different tube voltages at $8$\si{\cm}. A fit is then done to obtain the dose rate at any voltage. Fit results shows a quadratic dependence of the dose rate on the applied voltage which is more effective at high voltages (See figure~\ref{fig:432b}).

\subsection{Measurement of the Absorbed Dose Vs Depth}
\label{sec:S434}
A typical dose rate vs distance measurement, taken with the calibrated diode II, is shown in Fig ~\ref{fig:S434} for a beam energy of $40$\si{\kilo\volt} and tube current of $50$\si{\mA} with and without the Al filter. The measured dose rate was fit to a power law expression:
\begin{equation}
\text{Dose Rate}[\si{\mega\radian/\hour}]=\frac{a}{(h-b)^2}
\label{eq:434}
\end{equation}
where $h$ is the distance in \si{\cm} from the X-ray source. Tables~\ref{tab:S431a} and \ref{tab:S431b} show the data obtained with and without the Al filter.

Table ~\ref{tab:S432} , shows the power-law fit results based on the data shown in tables~\ref{tab:S431a}and ~\ref{tab:S431b}. The value of the offset (b) reflects the depth of the beam window in \si{\cm} with respect to the original x-ray source. The data yields a maximum dose rate at the source of $4.247$ \si{\mega\radian/\hour} with filter and $15.040$  \si{\mega\radian/\hour} without filter as shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:S434}. However, the minimum distance to the source is only 10 cm, thus the maximum dose rate achievable calculated as the average of the two measurements is $3.75\pm0.03$ MRad/h.
 While the value of (a) reflects the amplitude of dose rate in [\si{\mega\radian/\hour}] which decreased due to the attenuation of Al filter.
