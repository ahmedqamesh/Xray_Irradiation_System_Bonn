# Characterization of the X-ray Irradiation System @ Bonn
This page contains information and timetable of the X-ray irradiation system in Bonn Uni Physics department, SILAB group. This facility is located at Bonn university. It is accessible, upon request, to all users from the HEP community.
## Main Characteristics and Setup
The available x-ray tube uses a high voltage to accelerate electrons released by thermoionic effect in the electric field set by the operational voltage of the machine. The tube can be operated in a voltage range of **2 kV** to **60 kV** and continuously powered at **3 kW**. The characteristics of the tube are summarized in Tab 4.1.<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ahmedqamesh/Xray_Irradiation_System_Bonn/blob/master/images/tablexray.png" width = 600 title=""></p>The tube parameters are adjustable using a graphical user interface. The tube itself is installed at the top of a **110 cm× 70 cm × 103 cm** cabinet with lead-glass front window so that all measurements are performed inside this radiation safe housing (see Fig. 4.1(a)).<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ahmedqamesh/Xray_Irradiation_System_Bonn/blob/master/images/tablexraycabinet.png" width = 700 title=""></p>.
## GEANT4 Simulation
A measurement of the X-ray spectrum is very crucial, since the X-ray distributions influence the penetration of the X-rays through the target and so the absorbed radiation dose received. An accurate measurement of the X-ray spectrum is complex and time consuming because of the high count rates of the beam. A simulation in this case is a more convenient way to get the spectrum. For that purpose GEANT4 simulation (Version 4.10.p01 compiled with CLHEP 2.1.3.1 libraries) toolkit has been
used to simulate the X-ray spectrum produced by the tube and study the effect of tube potential and
filtration on the beam intensity.

## System Characterization
The essential information required for the characterization of an X-ray system is the X-ray dose rate as a function of tube current, tube voltage, and distance from the source. The effects of various source filters are also of interest. The measure of radiation due to X-rays is commonly expressed in Roentgen unit. A Roentgen (R) is defined as the quantity of X- or gamma radiation that produces a charge of 2.58 × 10^−4 coulombs in one kilogram of dry air at 0o C. In most applications, radiation
effects in other materials (e.g., silicon) are of primary interest, and the energy deposited per unit mass is a more meaningful measure of dose. For example, a dose of 1 rad is defined as an energy deposition of 100 erg/g of material. The official SI dose unit is the Gray, however the rad is still widely used where 1 Gy = 1 J/kg = 100 rad.
